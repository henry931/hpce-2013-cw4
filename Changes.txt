Changes I had to make to get things to work in Visual Studio 2012

Using AMD APP SDK header files and library

test_opencl.cpp:
Comment out #include <alloca.h>
Also need to use given (from CW download) header file as AMD header does not have enqueueBarrier as a member of CommandQueue

heat.cpp:
#include <string>

heat.cpp:
#include <string>

make_world.cpp:
strtof() not provided in header file. Use (float) strtod() instead

step_world.cpp:
strtof() not provided in header file. Use (float) strtod() instead

src/your_login/step_world_v3_opencl.cpp:
I needed to put #define NOMINMAX at the top to stop a minwindef.h macro than gave errors when usind std::min and std::max
(This issue was sparked by including the cl.hpp file for some reason)
